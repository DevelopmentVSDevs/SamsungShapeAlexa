# SamsungShapeAlexa

My Code for controlling my Samsung shape speakers with spotify connect via Alexa

Ok, so I am not a GO developer, but there was a GO library that did everything I needed.

So what we have here so far is a JSON-RPC daemon that interfaces the mdns and spotify pieces.   This commit is just to get it out of my sandbox in case it helps somebody else.   

More to come later hopefully
